Quick Installation Instructions
===============================

These instructions assume that you are starting in the installation directory after downloading and that
you are connecting to the database via SQL*Plus.

1) Pre-Installation
-------------------

If you want to install in a new schema (the default)....

    - Go to the scripts directory
    - connect to Oracle as a user with CREATE USER privileges
    - run crudo_owner.sql
    
    You will be prompted for :
        - the name of the new crudo Application Owner schema (CRUDO by default)
        - the default tablespace for the new schema ( USERS by default)
        - the temporary tablespace for the new schema (TEMP by default)
        - a password for the new schema
    This will create a database user.
    
If you want to install into an existing schema, you can check to make sure that the schema has the required privileges as follows :
    - Go to the scripts directory
    - connect to Oracle as the schema you want to install CRUDO into
    - run pre-install_check.sql
    
    Any additional grants required will be reported by this script.
    
    
2) Installation
---------------

Connect to the database as the user who will be the Application Owner.
Run crud_deploy.sql

Review the deployment log in the crud_deploy.log file which is generated in this directory.

3) Post-Installation
--------------------

To grant access to other database users :
    - Go to the scripts directory
    - connect to the database as either the application owner or a user with the GRANT ANY privilege
    - run grants.sql
    You will be prompted for :
        - The application owning schema (defaults to CRUDO)
        - The user to grant access to

4) SQLDeveloper Extension Deployment

If you use SQLDeveloper, there are two extensions available for CRUDO.
The first creates an additional tab in the Table View which displays the CRUD matrices for the table in context.
The second is on the right-click menu in the table node and lets you run a crud on the table in focus.

To add these extensions :

    1) Open SQLDeveloper.
    2) Go to the Tools Menu and Select Preferences.
    3) In the Preferences Tree, Expand the database node and click on User Defined Extensions.

    4) Click on the Add Row button.

    5) For the CRUD Tab 
        Select a type of Editor.
        Specify the location as the path and filename for crud_tab.xml

    6) For the Crud Table Menu 
        Specify a type of Action
        Specify the location as the path and filename for crud_table_action.xml

    7) Re-start SQLDeveloper
    
When you bring select a table in the connections tree you should now see a tab called CRUD Matrix added at the end of the list of tabs for the table.

If you right-click on the table, you should see a sub-menu called CRUDO Table Menu with a sub option called Crud Table.
